# HyperFrames entry point

This copy is part of Kiran's canonical skill library. Do not run `npx hyperframes skills update` from
this skill or its workflows: that command refreshes a separate global install and bypasses the
repository's provenance and review process. Update these files only through the repository's
upstream-review workflow.

HyperFrames **renders video from HTML** — a composition is an HTML file whose DOM declares timing with `data-*` attributes, whose animation runtime is seekable, and whose media playback is owned by the framework. The full authoring contract lives in `/hyperframes-core`; read it before writing composition HTML.

## 1. Start from project state

Apply the first matching row; do not evaluate lower state rows:

| State                                                                                                                         | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Explicit port of existing Remotion source to HyperFrames                                                                      | Read `references/routes/remotion-to-hyperframes.md`, then route directly to that workflow. Skip the intent layer.                                                                                           |
| Specific operation on an existing HyperFrames project: inspect, diagnose, validate, preview, render, publish, or batch-render | Perform only that operation. Skip intent and workflow routing; load `/hyperframes-cli` and any required domain skills.                                                                                      |
| Specific edit to an existing project                                                                                          | Make the edit. Do not run the intent layer.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `BRIEF.md` exists                                                                                                             | Read `workflow` and `flow`. Execute it only when it is `faceless-explainer` or `product-launch-video`; otherwise stop and report that this package does not include the requested workflow. Ask no brief questions. |
| No brief, but `hyperframes.json` or `STORYBOARD.md` exists                                                                    | Resume from project files and recorded preferences. Infer the owning workflow from existing artifacts. If it cannot be determined uniquely, ask one routing-only question; do not run the intent interview. |
| Fresh creation                                                                                                                | Run the intent layer — `references/intent-interview.md` — then route once using § 2's table.                                                                                                                |

If a fresh request does not identify the subject or input, ask what the video is about before routing. Check preferences and recipes before asking anything (`references/intent-interview.md`, step 1). A `figma.com` input or a named recipe changes intake, not routing — the interview's "Adapt orthogonal inputs" section handles both.

### Keep the project's CLI current

A scaffolded project pins `hyperframes@<version>` in its `package.json` scripts so renders stay reproducible; the pin never advances on its own, and a pinned run of an older CLI prints no warning about it. When resuming a project whose scripts carry a pin, probe once before the first render-affecting command:

```bash
npx hyperframes@latest upgrade --project . --check
```

The probe is read-only and reports the pin against the latest release; keep the explicit `.` — on older CLI releases a bare `--project` followed by another flag consumes that flag as its directory value. When it reports the project behind — or any CLI output already shows it (the stderr notice `This project pins hyperframes@… (latest …)`, or `_meta.updateAvailable: true` in a `--json` result from a pinned script) — apply with `npx hyperframes@latest upgrade --project .`, then verify with `npx hyperframes check`. A passing check confirms the project's compositions still validate on the new version — not that rendered output is frame-identical to the old pin — so a successful bump is never silent: name the old and new version in the run's summary. A project with no composition yet needs no verification. If the check fails, revert the `package.json` change, continue on the pinned version, and report which version the project stays on and why. Act on the signal rather than relaying it to the user; never leave a bumped pin unverified.

## 2. Route fresh creation

Use the first matching row. Match the requested **deliverable**, not a word or file type mentioned in passing.

| Priority | Request                                                                                                            | Workflow                   |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| 1        | Market or showcase a website, product site, app, or company from a URL or site-specific brief                      | `/product-launch-video`    |
| 2        | Explain a topic, article, or notes with invented visuals and no product or site capture                            | `/faceless-explainer`      |

Before finalizing the route, read `references/routes/<workflow>.md` for one of the two included
workflows. If the request is for another video genre, stop and explain that it needs a separately
reviewed upstream workflow; do not invent a route or fetch one during the task.

### Resolve common ambiguities

- A generic "make a video from this site" request is `/product-launch-video`; a topic, article, or
  notes request with invented visuals is `/faceless-explainer`.
- Existing footage, presentations, beat-synced music videos, code-change videos, and other genres
  are outside this package. Report the missing workflow instead of routing to an absent skill.
- Specialized narrative workflows support up to about 3 minutes and are strongest around 30–90s.
  Ask for a different workflow package for a clearly longer piece.

## 3. Route once, then leave

For fresh creation the intent layer (`references/intent-interview.md`) runs the full conversation — memory, triage, pitch round, must-haves, run-shape, hand-off — and **ends by writing `BRIEF.md`. The brief is the only routing artifact the workflow reads**; nothing later re-opens this skill or the interview. Answer every later "what did the route require?" from `BRIEF.md`.

## 4. Enter the workflow

The selected workflow and its core domain skills are already present in this library. Read the
matching local skill and its directed references. If a workflow is missing, stop and report that the
library needs an upstream review; do not fetch or overwrite a replacement during the task.

## 5. Load domain skills on demand

| Need                                                                                                                | Skill                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Composition structure, timing attributes, tracks, variables, determinism                                            | `/hyperframes-core`      |
| Motion rules, scene blueprints, transitions, runtime adapters                                                       | `/hyperframes-animation` |
| Seek-safe GSAP, CSS, Anime.js, WAAPI, FLIP, paths, masks, SVG, 3D keyframes, or `hyperframes keyframes` diagnostics | `/hyperframes-keyframes` |

| Images, icons, logos, audio, captions, grades, LUTs, reusable media                                                 | `/media-use`             |
| Voiceover carve, audio effect chains, automation envelopes, or one chain/fader across several tracks (submix bus)   | `/hyperframes-audio`     |
| Init, lint, check, snapshots, compare, batch render, Studio, render, publish, or diagnostics                        | `/hyperframes-cli`       |
| Registry blocks and components                                                                                      | `/hyperframes-registry`  |
| Figma assets, tokens, components, or storyboard frames as reconstructed motion                                      | upstream review required |

Creator edit phrases are cross-domain requests. Load every skill named in the matching row:

| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “cut this footage”, hard cut, trim, splice, reorder, or use a source range                                     | `/general-video` + `/hyperframes-core`; core owns `data-start`, `data-duration`, `data-media-start`, and track layout.                                                            |
| zoom in here, punch-in / punch-out, smooth multi-state zoom or reframe, Ken Burns, or camera move              | `/general-video` + `/hyperframes-core` + `/hyperframes-keyframes`; animate the inner visual/crop wrapper, not the timed clip.                                                     |
| match cut or whip pan camera transition                                                                        | `/general-video` + `/hyperframes-animation` + `/hyperframes-keyframes` + `/hyperframes-registry`; search/install a transition primitive before hand-authoring.                    |
| fade, crossfade, track gain/volume, automation, duck/carve, audio effects, or one effect across several tracks | `/general-video` + `/hyperframes-core` + `/hyperframes-audio`; core places clips, audio mixes placed tracks — including a submix bus over a group of them.                        |
| picture and sound edits that combine cuts with camera motion or mixing                                         | `/general-video` + `/hyperframes-core` + `/hyperframes-keyframes` when there is visual motion + `/hyperframes-audio` when sound is faded, mixed, ducked, automated, or processed. |
| source or generate media, or preprocess an unsupported speed ramp/mid-source freeze                            | `/media-use`; sourcing/generation/preprocessing only, never placed-track mixing.                                                                                                  |

Constant `data-playback-rate` is render-safe for picture and pitch-preserved
sound. It does not make source speed ramps keyframeable; preprocess ramps.
For copyable edit contracts, load `/hyperframes-core` → `references/creator-editing-recipes.md`.

Broad feedback about how photographic media looks or behaves also routes to
`/media-use`, even when the user never says “color grading” or “effect”: fix
dark/flat/boring footage, stylize a clip, hide a face, or improve a media
reveal. Read `../media-use/references/media-treatments.md` before editing a
treatment; it governs how footage is treated, never whether media may be used.
Do not substitute a generic LUT, CSS filter/overlay, or opacity tween for an
existing canonical treatment primitive. Keep text/layout/motion-only edits in
their owning domain.
During a build with important photographic media, include one grounded
media-polish scan in the final quality pass; leaving suitable media unchanged is
a valid result.

Domain skills never take ownership of the end-to-end deliverable. Load only what the active workflow needs.
